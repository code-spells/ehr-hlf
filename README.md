# INTEGRATING ELECTRONIC HEALTHCARE RECORD AND DRUG SUPPLY CHAIN USING HYPPERLEDGER FABRIC

# Description
Using hyperledger fabric to provide health record access to citizen with access control policies over its integration with hospitals, testlabs, pharmacy and
also tracking the drug transportation, right from manufacturers to retail pharmacy.

Medical history availability plays an important role in quick decision making for patient treatment and to make sure no medicine is provided to a patient
which has an adverse affect on patient due to an existing condition. However, medical history is a private matter for a patient which he would only want to
share with the parties involved in the treatment or to provide the medicines for the same.

The problem that we face in having a centralised server for storing the medical records is that the patients does not have the control over their data, there's a
chance of having data being misused, the difficulty in interoperability between different hospitals and other health institutions and the time taken for the
insurance claim, drug counterfeiting and the malfunctioning with the prescription drugs. Using a private blockchain with proper access control policies provides 
the solution for the prolems mentioned here.
